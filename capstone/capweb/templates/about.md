explainer: The Caselaw Access Project (“CAP”) expands public access to U.S. law. Our goal is to make all published U.S. court decisions freely available to the public online, in a consistent format, digitized from the collection of the Harvard Law School Library.

# What data do we have? {: class="subtitle" data-toc-label='Our Data' } 

CAP includes all official, book-published United States case law — every volume designated as an official report of 
decisions by a court within the United States.

Our scope includes all state courts, federal courts, and territorial courts for American Samoa, Dakota Territory, Guam, 
Native American Courts, Navajo Nation, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Our earliest case is from 1658, and our most 
recent cases are from 2018.

Each volume has been converted into structured, case-level data broken out by majority and dissenting opinion, with 
human-checked metadata for party names, docket number, citation, and date.

We also offer PDFs with selectable OCR text for each case. 


# Scope limits {: class="subtitle" } 

CAP does not include:

* New cases as they are published. We currently include volumes published through June, 2018, and may or may not include
 additional volumes in the future.
* Cases not designated as officially published, such as most lower court decisions.
* Non-published trial documents such as party filings, orders, and exhibits.
* Parallel versions of cases from regional reporters, unless those cases were designated by a court as official.
* Cases officially published in digital form, such as recent cases from Illinois, Arkansas, New Mexico, and North Carolina.
{: add_list_class="spacious-list bullets" }

Cases published after 1922 do not include headnotes.


# By the numbers {: class="subtitle" }

Here are some tsv-formatted spreadsheets with specific counts from our collection, and links to view those cases in the 
API:

* [Case Count by Reporter Series]({% url "download-files" "cases_by_reporter.tsv" %})
* [Case Count by Jurisdiction]({% url "download-files" "cases_by_jurisdiction.tsv" %})
* [Case Count by Decision Date]({% url "download-files" "cases_by_decision_date.tsv" %})

# Digitization Process {: class="subtitle" data-toc-label='Digitization' } 

We created this data by digitizing roughly 40 million pages of court decisions contained in roughly 40,000 bound volumes
owned by the Harvard Law School Library.

Members of our team created metadata for each volume, including a unique barcode, reporter name, title, jurisdiction, 
publication date and other volume-level information. We then used a high-speed scanner to produce JP2 and TIF images of
every page. A vendor then used OCR to extract the text of every case, creating case-level XML files. Key metadata 
fields, like case name, citation, court and decision date, were corrected for accuracy, while the text of each case was
left as raw OCR output. In addition, for cases from volumes not yet in the public domain, our vendor redacted any 
headnotes.

# Data quality {: class="subtitle" }

Our data inevitably includes countless errors as part of the digitization process. **The public launch of this project 
is only the start of discovering errors, and we hope you will help us in finding and 
fixing them.**{: class="highlighted" } 

Some parts of our data are higher quality than others. Case metadata, such as the party names, docket number, citation, 
and date, has received human review. Case text and general head matter has been generated by machine OCR and has not 
received human review.

You can report errors of all kinds at our Github issue tracker, where you can also see currently known issues. We 
particularly welcome metadata corrections, feature requests, and suggestions for large-scale algorithmic changes. We are
not currently able to process individual OCR corrections, but welcome general suggestions on the OCR correction process.


# Data citation {: class="subtitle" }

# Usage & access {: class="subtitle" } 

The CAP data is free for the public to use and access.
{: class="highlighted" } 

Case metadata, such as the case name, citation, court, date, etc., is freely and openly accessible without limitation. 
Full case text can be freely viewed or downloaded but you must register for an account to do so, and currently you may 
view or download no more than 500 cases per day. In addition, research scholars can qualify for bulk data access by 
agreeing to certain use and redistribution restrictions. You can request a bulk access agreement by creating an account 
and then visiting your account page.

Access limitations on full text and bulk data are a component of Harvard’s collaboration agreement with Ravel Law, Inc. 
(now part of Lexis-Nexis). These limitations will end, at the latest, in March of 2024. In addition, these limitations 
apply only to cases from jurisdictions that continue to publish their official case law in print form. Once a 
jurisdiction transitions from print-first publishing to digital-first publishing, these limitations cease. Thus far, 
Illinois, Arkansas, New Mexico, and North Carolina have made this important and positive shift and, as a result,
all historical cases from these jurisdictions are freely available to the public without restriction. We hope many
other jurisdictions will follow their example soon.

# Getting Legal Help {: class="subtitle" } 

The Caselaw Access Project team cannot help with personal legal research problems or legal representation. Our data is 
valuable for scholarship, but it is a work in progress and is not kept up to date. Please do not rely on our data set to
solve personal legal problems.

Finding a lawyer: see the list of links on the Harvard Law School Library's page 
[Where can I get legal advice?](https://asklib.law.harvard.edu/faq/115265)

Alternate databases: if you need to conduct up-to-date research for use in a legal proceeding, consider
[one of these alternate databases](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/alternatelegaldatabases).

Learning to conduct legal research: If you have access to a 
[public law library](http://www.washlaw.edu/statecourtcounty/), its librarians should be able to help you learn legal 
research skills. The Harvard Law School Library Reference Desk may also be able to offer assistance through their 
[Ask a Librarian](https://asklib.law.harvard.edu/) service.
