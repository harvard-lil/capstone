  <p>
    Caselaw Access Project is operated by the President and Fellows of
    Harvard College (“Harvard”) in support of its mission to educate and
    disseminate knowledge and information. As used in Privacy Policy, “CAP”
    refers to the Caselaw Access Project and to Harvard more generally.
  </p>

  <p>
    CAP is committed to preserving your privacy and being transparent about how we use information collected through the case.law website (the “Website”) and any other applications, functionality or services offered by CAP (collectively with the Website, the “Services”). This privacy policy describes how CAP uses, collects, and shares information through the Services.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What types of information does CAP collect?</h2>

  <h3>1.1. Usage Data</h3>

  <p>As with most services, CAP may automatically collect certain information when you use the Services, even when you are not logged in. CAP collects this information when you access the Services, including when you set up an account or browse, read, or download information from the Services. This type of information may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, URL request, browser type, and the date and time of a request. CAP may use cookies or other automated mechanisms to collect this information and may collect this information on an aggregate or individual basis. Cookies are small text files that the Services can send to your browser for storage on your computer. They make use of the Website easier by saving your status and preferences and refreshing them every time you use the Website. For instance, to facilitate registration and login functions, CAP may use cookies to recognize when you return to the Website so that you do not have to resubmit your logon credentials. In order to clear this logon information, for example if using a public terminal, you should log out of your account. While many browsers allow you to change your settings in order to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent, it is recommended that you leave cookies enabled, as disabling cookies may interfere with some functionality of the Services.</p>

  <h3>1.2. Personal Information</h3>

  <p>In order to access certain parts of the Services, CAP may require you to provide personal information, such as your name and email address. CAP uses this information to manage your account, communicate with you, and provide the Services to you. CAP will not collect any personal information from your use of the Services unless you choose to provide it by registering for an account or otherwise posting, sending, or uploading the information to the Services.</p>

  <h2>2. How does CAP Use the Information It Collects?</h2>

  <p>CAP uses the information that it collects to deliver and improve the Services, administer mailing lists and online communities, and other activities related to the provision of the Services. CAP may retain all data and content collected through the Services for restorative, archival, or research purposes. </p>

  <h2>3. When does CAP disclose information to third parties?</h2>

  <p>CAP uses third party services providers, such as web analytics providers, infrastructure providers, and other similar providers, to help deliver the Services. CAP may share the information it collects through the Services with these service providers as necessary to provide or improve the Services. CAP may also share certain information it collects with its research partners. In addition, although CAP will not publicly share personal information unless you choose to make that information public, CAP may publicly share aggregated data or statistics related to the Services that may include anonymized user information or usage statistics. Finally, CAP may share information when responding to a request from law enforcement, or to prevent malicious use of the Services. In the event that CAP is required by law to disclose any information related to your account, CAP will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of the request by email, unless CAP is prohibited by law or government order from doing so. CAP will not sell information it collects or stores through the Services to any third parties for monetary compensation.</p>

  <h2>4. What if I access another website or third party service through the Services?</h2>

  <p>CAP may link you to or provide you access to services or websites offered by third parties, such as libraries, museums, archives, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other similar services. Please note that this privacy policy does not apply to the practices of those third parties, and CAP is not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. Please make sure you are comfortable with the privacy practices of these third parties before using their services.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>

  <p>CAP has taken efforts to put security measures in place to protect information and data that is collected through the Services. However, CAP cannot guarantee or warrant that any information collected through the Services will remain confidential, and many functions of the Services are intended to make information and content publicly available. You are responsible for setting and maintaining the security of your password. CAP may not keep a copy of your password, so please safeguard the password associated with your account and do not share your password with third parties.</p>

  <h2>6. Transfer of Information</h2>

  <p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers and databases located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction. Please be advised that we may transfer your information to and from any state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction, and process it in the United States or elsewhere. By using the Services, you consent to any such transfer of your information.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>CAP reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time at its discretion. If CAP does make changes to this privacy policy, CAP will update this page accordingly. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this privacy policy, terms used in this privacy policy have the same meanings as in the Terms of Use.</p>
