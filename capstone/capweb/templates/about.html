  The Caselaw Access Project (&#8220;CAP&#8221;) expands public access to U.S. law.
  <br/>
  Our goal is to make all published U.S. court decisions freely available to the public online, in a consistent format, digitized from the collection of the Harvard Law Library.

  {# ==============> DATA <============== #}
  <div class="page-section">
    <h2 class="subtitle" id="data">What data do we have?</h2>
    <p>
      CAP includes all official, book-published United States case law — every volume designated as an official
      report of decisions by a court within the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our scope includes all state courts, federal courts, and territorial courts for American
      Samoa, Dakota Territory, Guam, Native American Courts, Navajo Nation, and the Northern Mariana
      Islands. Our earliest case is from 1658, and our most recent cases are from 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each volume has been converted into structured, case-level data broken out by majority and dissenting
      opinion, with human-checked metadata for party names, docket number, citation, and date.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also plan to share (but have not yet published) page images and page-level OCR data for all volumes.
    </p>
  </div>

  {# ==============> LIMITS <============== #}
  <div class="page-section">
    <h2 class="subtitle" id="limits">Scope limits</h2>
    <p>CAP does not include:</p>
    <ul class="spacious-list bullets">
        <li>
          New cases as they are published. We currently include volumes published through
          June, 2018, and may or may not include additional volumes in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cases not designated as officially published, such as most lower court decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Non-published trial documents such as party filings, orders, and exhibits.
        </li>
        <li>
          Parallel versions of cases from regional reporters, unless those cases were
          designated by a court as official.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cases officially published in digital form, such as recent cases from Illinois and Arkansas.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cases published after 1922 do not include headnotes.

      Here are some tsv-formatted spreadsheets with specific counts from our collection, and links to view
      those cases in the API:

  <div class="page-section">

      Digitization Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      We created this data by digitizing roughly 40 million pages of court decisions contained in roughly 40,000 bound volumes owned by the Harvard Law School Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members of our team created metadata for each volume, including a unique barcode, reporter name, title, jurisdiction, publication date and other volume-level information. We then used a high-speed scanner to produce JP2 and TIF images of every page. A vendor then used OCR to extract the text of every case, creating case-level XML files. Key metadata fields, like case name, citation, court and decision date, were corrected for accuracy, while the text of each case was left as raw OCR output. In addition, for cases from volumes not yet in the public domain, our vendor redacted any headnotes.
    </p>
  </div>
  {# ==============> DATA QUALITY <============== #}
  <div class="page-section">
    <h2 class="subtitle" id="data-quality">Data quality</h2>
    <p>
      Our data inevitably includes countless errors as part of the digitization process.
      <span class="highlighted">The public launch of this project is only the start of discovering
        errors, and we hope you will help us in finding and fixing them.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some parts of our data are higher quality than others. Case metadata, such as the party names, docket
      number, citation, and date, has received human review. Case text and general head matter has been
      generated by machine OCR and has not received human review.</p>
    <p>
      You can report errors of all kinds at
      <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone/labels/Data">our Github issue tracker</a>, where you
      can also see currently known issues. We particularly welcome metadata corrections, feature requests,
      and suggestions for large-scale algorithmic changes. We are not currently able to process individual
      OCR corrections, but welcome general suggestions on the OCR correction process.

      Data made available through the Caselaw Access Project API and bulk download service is citable.

  {# ==============> USAGE <============== #}
  <div class="page-section">
    <h2 class="subtitle" id="usage">Usage &amp; access</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="highlighted">The CAP data is free for the public to use and access.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Case metadata, such as the case name, citation, court, date, etc.,
        is freely and openly accessible without limitation.
        Full case text can be freely viewed or downloaded but
        you must register for an account to do so, and currently you may
        view or download no more than 500 cases per day. In addition,
        research scholars can qualify for bulk data access by agreeing to certain use and redistribution restrictions.
        You can request a research agreement by <a href="{% url "register" %}">creating an account</a>
        and then <a href="{% url "user-details" %}">visiting your account page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access limitations on full text and bulk data are a component of Harvard’s
        collaboration agreement with Ravel Law, Inc. (now part of Lexis-Nexis).
        These limitations will end, at the latest, in March of 2024.
        In addition, these limitations apply only to cases from
        jurisdictions that continue to publish their official case law in print form.
        Once a jurisdiction transitions from print-first publishing to digital-first publishing,
        these limitations cease. Thus far, Illinois and Arkansas have made this important and positive
        shift and, as a result, all historical cases from these jurisdictions are freely available to the public
        without restriction. We hope many other jurisdictions will follow their example soon.
