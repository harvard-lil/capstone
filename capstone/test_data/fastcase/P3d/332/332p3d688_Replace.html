    <p id="p-23"><strong>I. BACKGROUND</strong></p>
    <p id="p-24"><strong>A. The Management Plan</strong></p>
    <p id="p-25">In 1961, the State of Hawai'i (<strong>State</strong> ) transferred approximately eighteen acres of land on the summit of Haleakala, on the island of Maui, to the University on the condition that the land be set aside for the Haleakala High Altitude Observatory Site (<strong>Observatory Site</strong> ). The Observatory Site, located within a conservation district, is in a subzone which specifically permits astronomy facilities. <em>See</em> Hawai'i Administrative Rules (<strong>HAR</strong> ) §§ 13-5-24(c) (effective 1994) and 13-5-25(a) (effective 1994). The University published the Management Plan for the. Observatory Site in June, 2010. The Management Plan is "implemented to regulate land use in the Conservation District for the purpose of conserving, protecting, and preserving the important natural resources of the State" and provides over-arching monitoring strategies, as well as design and construction guidelines, for the Observatory Site. The Management Plan is a prerequisite for building astronomy facilities at the Observatory Site. <em>See</em> HAR § 13-5-24(c)(4)(R-3) and (astronomy facilities may be constructed in a conservation district general subzone only if the project receives approval of a board permit and management plan).</p>
    <p id="p-26">On October 25, 2010, the University issued a Final Environmental Assessment<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> <strong>(Final EA)</strong> for the Management Plan. The Final EA lists the University as the proposing and approving agency, and provides that the Final EA review triggers are the use of State lands or funds and the use of conservation district lands. The Final EA defined the proposed action as "the implementation of a [Management Plan], which would regulate land use in the Conservation District...." The Final EA also provides that the implementation of the Management Plan "is intended to comply with Exhibit 3 of HAR § 13-5<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and is not intended to assess impacts from construction or operation of any new project at [the Observatory Site]...."</p>
    <p id="p-27">Based on the Final EA, the University determined the implementation of the Management Plan would not have a significant effect on the environment (<strong>Negative Declaration</strong> ) and did not require the preparation of an EIS as a result. <em>See</em> HAR § 11-200-9(A)(4) (effective 1996); <em>see also</em> <em>Kepo'o v. Kane,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=106%20Haw.%20270" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="106 Haw. 270">106 Hawai'i 270</a>, 289, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20939" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="103 P.3d 939">103 P.3d 939</a>, 958 (2005) (the proper inquiry for determining the necessity of an EIS is whether the proposed action will likely have a significant effect on the environment). The Board approved the Management Plan on December 1, 2010.</p>
    <p id="p-28"><strong>B. Kilakila's Challenge of the Management Plan</strong></p>
    <p id="p-29">On November 22, 2010, Kilakila filed a "Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief" against the University. Count 1 of the complaint challenged the University's Negative Declaration. On December 13, 2010, Kilakila amended its complaint to allege three additional counts. Counts 2, 3 and 4 raised various challenges against the Telescope Project, a proposed astronomy facility submitted with the Management Plan. Kilakila's prayer for relief requested the circuit court:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-30">A. Declare that [the University] violated HRS Chapter 343.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-31"><a id="p692" href="#p692" data-label="692" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*692</a><a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="2" class="page-label">**90</a>B. Declare that [the University] must prepare an EIS for the [Management Plan].</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-32">C. Declare that the [University] improperly accepted the [Final EA] for [the Management Plan].</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-33">D. Declare that [the Management Plan] may have a significant impact.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-34">E. Declare that any approvals granted pursuant to the [Final EA] for the [Management Plan] are null and void.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-35">F. Declare that [the Management Plan] is null and void.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-36">G. Declare that all permits granted pursuant to the [Management Plan], including the [CDU permit] for the [Telescope Project], are null and void.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-37">....</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-38">L. Order [the University] to prepare an EIS for the [Management Plan] if they wish for the plan to be approved.</blockquote>
    <p id="p-39">On January 18, 2011, the University moved for a protective order barring all discovery requests by Kilakila under Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (<strong>HRCP</strong> ) Rule 26(c). The University argued discovery was not required to resolve the matter because the question of whether the University had complied with HRS Chapter 343 was a question of law, not fact, and the circuit court's review was limited to the administrative record. The circuit court granted the Protective Order on March 14, 2011.</p>
    <p id="p-40">On May 9, 2011, the circuit court granted summary judgment against Kilakila and dismissed counts 2, 3 and 4, concluding the court lacked jurisdiction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> On April 18, 2012, Kilakila filed a motion to reconsider this decision and the circuit court denied the motion on May 29, 2012. On October 5, 2011, the University filed a motion for summary judgment on count 1, contending primarily that an EA was not required but was conducted to allow informed decision-making and such action complied with the "rule of reason." On January 17, 2013, the circuit court entered an order granting the University's motions and joinder for summary judgment on count 1. The circuit court concluded:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-41">The [circuit court] finds that under the notice pleading standard, Count 1 of the Second Amended Complaint alleges that the [Telescope Project] is a component of the [Management Plan], and that an [EIS] should have been prepared for the Management Plan pursuant to [HRS] Chapter 343. In making its determination, the [circuit court] looks to the [HRS], the [HAR], the Management Plan and case law including <em>Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. University of Hawai'i.</em></blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-42">The [circuit court] finds that an [EA] was prepared for the Management Plan and that an EIS was not required. The Management Plan is a guideline, a planning tool, that sets certain policies with respect to if there are future actions or projects one must consider certain monitoring strategies and take into consideration [the] cultural, religious and other resources. The Management Plan does not authorize specific projects, such as the [Telescope Project]. A future project requires its own environmental review. The [Telescope Project] did a separate EIS.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-43">The [circuit court] finds that an EIS was not required for the Management Plan. Nevertheless an [EA] for the Management Plan was prepared and complied with [HRS] Chapter 343 under the rule of reason standard set forth in case law including <em>Unite Here! Local 5 v. City and County of Honolulu,</em> 124 [Hawai'i] 171, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=238%20P.3d%20698" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="238 P.3d 698">238 P.3d 698</a> (2010).</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-44">With respect to the [DLNR's] motion, the [circuit court] further finds that notwithstanding notice pleading, a multi-step process is propounded regarding why the [DLNR is] a party. This process does not concern the Management Plan or whether [HRS] Chapter 343 was violated, and the [circuit court] grants the [DLNR's] Motion on that ground as well as on the merits. The [University's] joinder is granted for the same reason.</blockquote>

    <p id="p-46"><strong>C. The Telescope Project</strong></p>
    <p id="p-47">The Telescope Project is a proposed land use described by the Management Plan as a reasonably foreseeable project. A final EIS for the Telescope Project was prepared in July of 2009, before the University published the Management Plan. On December 1, 2010, the Board approved the University's application to construct the Telescope Project within the Observatory Site, issuing CDU Permit MA-3542 (<strong>Board's 2010 Approval</strong> ). On December 13, 2010, Kilakila filed an administrative agency appeal to the circuit court challenging the Board's 2010 Approval. <em>See '</em> <em>O Haleakala v. Bd. of Land &amp; Natural Res.,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=131%20Haw.%20193" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="131 Haw. 193">131 Hawai'i 193</a>, 197, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=317%20P.3d%2027" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="317 P.3d 27">317 P.3d 27</a>, 31 (2013).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> On February 11, 2011, while the agency appeal was pending, the Board approved Kilakila's request-a request that was made before the Board's 2010 Approval-for a contested case hearing on CDU permit MA-3542. <em>See '</em> <em>O Haleakala,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=131%20Haw.%20193" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="131 Haw. 193">131 Hawai'i at 198</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=317%20P.3d%2027" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="317 P.3d 27">317 P.3d at 32</a>. As a result, the circuit court dismissed the agency appeal as moot. <em>See <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=317%20P.3d%2027" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="317 P.3d 27">id.</a></em></p>
    <p id="p-48"><em>BQP:0021</em> <em>'O Haleakala</em> held that the circuit court had jurisdiction to review Kilakila's challenge under HRS § 91-14 (2012 Repl.) because the Board effectively denied Kilakila's request for a contested case hearing when it approved CDU Permit MA-3542 without rendering a decision on Kilakila's request. <em>See</em> <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=317%20P.3d%2027" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="317 P.3d 27">id.,</a></em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=131%20Haw.%20193" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="131 Haw. 193">131 Hawai'i at 203</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=317%20P.3d%2027" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="317 P.3d 27">317 P.3d at 37</a>. On December 13, 2013, the Hawai'i Supreme Court remanded the case to the circuit court to decide Kilakila's request for a stay or reversal of the Board's 2010 Approval. <em>See '</em> <em>O Haleakala,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=131%20Haw.%20193" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="131 Haw. 193">131 Hawai'i at 206</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=317%20P.3d%2027" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="317 P.3d 27">317 P.3d at 40</a>.</p>
    <p id="p-49">Meanwhile, on November 9, 2012, following the contested case hearing for CDU Permit MA-3542, the Board again approved the University's permit application, issuing CDU Permit MA-11-04 (<strong>Board's 2012 Approval</strong> ). Kilakila's challenge of the Board's 2012 Approval is before this court in pending case No. CAAP-13-0003065.</p>
    <p id="p-50"><strong>II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</strong></p>
    <p id="p-51"><strong>A. Summary Judgment</strong></p>
    <p id="p-52">We review summary judgments de novo. <em>See</em> <em>Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn &amp; Stifel,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=117%20Haw.%2092" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="117 Haw. 92">117 Hawai'i 92</a>, 104, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=176%20P.3d%2091" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="176 P.3d 91">176 P.3d 91</a>, 103 (2008). Under HRCP Rule 56(c), the circuit court must grant a motion for summary judgment when the moving party: (1) has shown that there is no genuine issue regarding any material fact, and (2) is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=176%20P.3d%2091" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="176 P.3d 91">Id.</a></em> "A fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties." <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=176%20P.3d%2091" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="176 P.3d 91">Id.</a></em></p>
    <p id="p-53">If the moving party meets its burden of production, the non-moving party must present admissible evidence showing specific facts about essential elements of each claim to avoid summary judgment. <em>See</em> <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=477%20U.S.%20317" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="477 U.S. 317">477 U.S. 317</a>, 322-23, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=106%20S.%20Ct.%202548" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="106 S. Ct. 2548">106 S.Ct. 2548</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=91%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20265" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="91 L. Ed. 2d 265">91 L.Ed.2d 265</a> (1986). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party; factual inferences are made in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See</em> <em>Kamaka,</em> at <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=117%20Haw.%2092" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="117 Haw. 92">117 Hawai'i at 104</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=176%20P.3d%2091" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="176 P.3d 91">176 P.3d at 103</a>.</p>
    <p id="p-54">In cases of public importance, summary judgments should be granted sparingly, and never on limited and indefinite factual foundations. <em>Molokai Homesteaders Coop. Ass'n v. Cobb,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=63%20Haw.%20453" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="63 Haw. 453">63 Haw. 453</a>, 458, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=629%20P.2d%201134" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="629 P.2d 1134">629 P.2d 1134</a>, 1139 (1981). But where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and defendants clearly demonstrate they should prevail as a matter of law, the disposition of a case by summary judgment is proper. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=629%20P.2d%201134" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="629 P.2d 1134">Id.</a></em></p>
    <p id="p-55"><strong>B. Discovery Order</strong></p>
    <p id="p-56">We disturb a trial court's discovery order only if there is a clear abuse of discretion that results in substantial prejudice to a party. <em>See</em> <em>Hac v. University of Hawai'i,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=102%20Haw.%2092" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="102 Haw. 92">102 Hawai'i 92</a>, 101, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=73%20P.3d%2046" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="73 P.3d 46">73 P.3d 46</a>, 55 (2003).

    <p id="p-67">To implement these broad objectives, HRS Chapter 343 creates a process of review, aiming to "alert decision makers to significant environmental effects which may result from the implementation of certain actions" and "ensure that environmental concerns are given appropriate consideration in decision making along with economic and technical considerations." HRS § 343-1 (2010 Repl.). The heart of this review process is the EIS. <em>See generally</em> <em>Molokai Homesteaders,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=63%20Haw.%20453" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="63 Haw. 453">63 Haw. at 464</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=629%20P.2d%201134" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="629 P.2d 1134">629 P.2d at 1142</a> (arguing the EIS is the heart of HRS Chapter 343's federal counterpart, the National Environmental Policy Act).

    <p id="p-90">Kilakila contends the circuit court erred in concluding that on summary judgment the University's Negative Declaration complied with HRS Chapter 343. Kilakila's argument is composed of two subparts: (1) the University failed to consider HAR 11-200-12, specifically regarding secondary and cumulative effects of the Management Plan, and (2) the circuit court erred by limiting discovery.</p>
    <p id="p-91"><strong>1. The circuit court did not err by concluding the Management Plan's EA complied with HRS Chapter 343 and that an EIS was not required as a matter of law.</strong></p>
    <p id="p-92">Kilakila contends the University's Negative Declaration did not consider the appropriate environmental factors because: (1) the Telescope Project, the development of which is facilitated by the Management Plan, is a secondary impact of the Management Plan, (2) the Telescope Project's EIS concluded that visual and noise impacts of the Telescope Project would likely affect cultural resources adversely,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and as a result, (3) the University's determination that the Management Plan would not have a significant impact on the environment indicates the University failed to consider HAR § 11-200-12. Analogous challenges have been addressed by the Hawai'i Supreme Court in <em>Molokai Homesteaders, Kepo'o</em> , and <em>Sierra Club.</em></p>
    <p id="p-93">In <em>Molokai Homesteaders,</em> a private developer sought to lease space in a county water distribution system. <em>See</em> <em>Molokai Homesteaders,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=63%20Haw.%20453" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="63 Haw. 453">63 Haw. at 456-57</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=629%20P.2d%201134" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="629 P.2d 1134">629 P.2d at 1138</a>. The Board in <em>Molokai Homesteaders</em> determined the proposed action would not have a significant effect on the environment, issued a negative declaration, and approved the action. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=629%20P.2d%201134" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="629 P.2d 1134">Id.</a></em> This approval predated the enactment of HRS Chapter 343.

In dicta, the Hawai'i Supreme Court explained that under HRS Chapter 343, had it applied, the proposed action was one where a significant effect was indeed likely because it facilitated the development of a large resort complex and likely involved the irrevocable commitment of natural resources:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-94">We entertain no doubt that the pertinent statutory provisions would mandate the preparation of an EIS if [the developer's] application for "rental of space" in the System's facilities were presented to the Board now. A proposal whose approval would facilitate the development of a large resort complex in a previously unpopulated area through the use of the Molokai Irrigation System's pipeline, allow water to be transported from its source to another area, and cause a rise in the salinity of the system's irrigation water would be within the purview of activities covered by [HRS] Chapter 343. The use of a government pipeline, the implicit commitment of prime natural resources to a particular purpose, perhaps irrevocably, and the substantial social and economic consequences of the governmental approval of the proposal would dictate the preparation of an EIS.</blockquote>

    <p id="p-96"><em>Kepo'o</em> also addressed the question of whether a proposed action was likely to have a significant impact and require an EIS. <em>Kepo'o,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=106%20Haw.%20270" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="106 Haw. 270">106 Hawai'i at 289-90</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20939" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="103 P.3d 939">103 P.3d at 958-59</a>. <em>Kepo'o</em> concluded that because the proposed action involved an irrevocable commitment <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="2" class="page-label">**95</a><a id="p697" href="#p697" data-label="697" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*697</a>of natural resources, an EIS was required:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-97">The EA in the present case indicates that the proposed power plant would essentially commit 86,000 gallons of fuel to plant operations per day, withdraw 10.4 million gallons of groundwater per day, and discharge hundreds of tons of air pollutants into the atmosphere each year, exceeding significance levels under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program. Although [the Plaintiffs] maintain that numerous "undisputed facts" show that the power plant "may have a significant effect on the environment," the aforementioned facts meet the definition of "significant effect." As defined in HRS § 343-2, "significant effect" includes irrevocable commitment of natural resources. The burning of thousands of gallons of fuel and the withdrawal of millions of gallons of groundwater on a daily basis will "likely" cause such irrevocable commitment. Therefore, the preparation of an EIS was required pursuant to both the common meaning of "may" and the statutory definition of "significant effect."</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-98">The power plant also involves effects that are similar to the effects of the proposed project in <em>Molokai Homesteaders.</em> In addition to the substantial fuel consumption and withdrawal of groundwater, the proposed plant would increase the salinity of the groundwater (because of the re-injection of water with higher salinity levels into the injections wells), bring oil by sea to Kawaihae Harbor, and pump the oil through pipes running under the State highway to the plant. These aspects of the power plant mirror the effects posed by the use of the transmission facilities of the Molokai Irrigation System, a project that would have necessitated an EIS.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-99">Finally, as the court observed, an EIS was mandated by the pre-1996 rule for "significance criteria." Even though the "substantial energy consumption" category did not exist when Chairperson Drake issued the negative declaration in 1993, the proposed project triggered at least one other category that was in existence in 1993, namely that it "[i]nvolves an irrevocable commitment to loss or destruction of any natural or cultural resource." HAR § 11-200-12(b). As previously discussed, the withdrawal of 10.4 million gallons of groundwater and the burning of 86,000 gallons of fuel on a daily basis "[i]nvolves an irrevocable commitment to loss or destruction of" natural resources. Thus, an EIS was required pursuant to HRS § 343-5(c) and under both the pre-and post-1996 versions of the significance criteria enumerated in HAR § 11-200-12(b).</blockquote>

    <p id="p-101"><em>Molokai Homesteaders</em> and <em>Kepo'o</em> essentially reasoned that the agency determining that a significant impact was not likely could not have considered the appropriate factors since the proposed actions involved irrevocable commitments of natural resources. The proposed action in both cases, the withdrawal and consumption of large amounts of water, itself involved a commitment of natural resources. Whether the Management Plan in this case involves a similar commitment is less clear.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> At its heart, the Management Plan exists to conserve resources rather than commit them to a specific purpose. However, the Management Plan's EA appears to suggest the routine management of the Observatory Site involves some commitment of cultural resources:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-102">There is no way to fully quantify the cumulative effects of past and ongoing action on traditional cultural practices and spiritual values.

    <p id="p-103">(Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="p-104"><em>Molokai Homesteaders</em> and <em>Kepo'o</em> found the agency failed to take a hard look at the appropriate environmental considerations where the proposed action created a new, or additional, commitment of natural resources. Rather than making additional commitments of natural resources, the Management Plan would mitigate existing commitments.</p>
    <p id="p-105">Much of Kilakila's challenge of the Management Plan's Final EA is founded not on the contention the Management Plan will likely have a significant impact on the environment, but is instead founded on the contention the Telescope Project, as a secondary effect of the Management Plan, has a significant impact on the environment. To this end, Kilakila relies heavily on <em>Sierra Club. Sierra Club</em> differs from <em>Molokai Homesteaders</em> and <em>Kepo'o</em> because the petitioner in <em>Sierra Club</em> challenged an agency's determination that a proposed action was exempt from the EA requirement, and not a determination that an EIS was not required. <em>See Sierra Club.</em> However, an agency making an exemption determination "must look beyond an action's facial compliance with an exemption class, and also <em>determine that the activity will probably not have a significant effect.</em>" <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20939" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="103 P.3d 939">Id.,</a></em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=115%20Haw.%20299" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="115 Haw. 299">115 Hawai'i at 340</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=167%20P.3d%20292" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="167 P.3d 292">167 P.3d at 333</a> (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="p-106">In <em>Sierra Club,</em> the Department of Transportation (<strong>DOT</strong> ) proposed harbor improvements and the petitioner contended the agency failed to consider secondary impacts resulting from activity facilitated by the harbor improvements:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-107">The exemption letter does not consider whether Superferry operation independent of the harbor will have any-significant effect on the environment. Rather, DOT appears to studiously restrict its consideration of environmental impact to the physical harbor improvements themselves. Although DOT does say that "[t]he installation and result of the minor improvements noted will not produce or create any adverse air quality, noise or water quality impact," which could imply a reference to the Superferry itself, as the "result" of the harbor improvements, this statement is oblique and does not indicate that secondary impacts were considered.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="p-109">Stated simply, the record in this case shows that DOT did not consider whether its facilitation of the [Hawai'i] Superferry Project will probably have minimal or no significant impacts, both primary and secondary, on the environment. Therefore, based on this record, we can only conclude that DOT's determination that the improvements to Kahului Harbor are exempt from the requirements of [Hawai'i Environmental Policy Act] was erroneous as a matter of law. The exemption being invalid, the EA requirement of HRS § 343-5 is applicable.</blockquote>

    <p id="p-126">This record does not show that the University failed to follow the proper procedures or failed to consider § 11-200-12 when it made the Negative Declaration for the Management Plan. As such, the circuit court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of the University on Count 1.</p>
    <p id="p-127"><strong>2. The circuit court did not err by granting the University's Protective Order.</strong></p>
    <p id="p-128">HRCP Rule 26(c) provides that the court may, for good cause shown, "make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including ... that the ... discovery not be had[.]" The University moved for a protective order barring discovery requests served by Kilakila under HRCP Rule 26(c), contending the University's compliance with HRS Chapter 343 was a question of law, not fact, and the circuit court's review was limited to the agency's administrative record. The circuit court, "having reviewed [the University's] Motion for Protective Order, [DLNR's] substantive joinder therein, the memoranda, declarations and reply in support thereof and opposition thereto, and the files and records herein, and for good cause shown," granted the motion.</p>
    <p id="p-129">Kilakila contends the circuit court's review is not limited to the administrative record since <em>Kepo'o</em> involved a challenge of a negative declaration. The Hawai'i Supreme Court's statement that "summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, <em>if any,</em> show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law," indicated the circuit court's review was not limited to the administrative record. <em>Kepo'o,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=106%20Haw.%20270" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="106 Haw. 270">106 Hawai'i at 287</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20939" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="103 P.3d 939">103 P.3d at 956</a> (internal quotation marks, citations omitted and emphasis added). <em>Kepo'o</em> merely cited the standard of review for summary judgment, quoting <em>Heatherly v.

    <p id="p-130">Kilakila also maintains that challenges to compliance with HRS Chapter 343 are not restricted to an administrative record since the circuit court and Hawai'i Supreme Court in <em>Unite Here!

    <p id="p-131">Here, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by granting the Protective Order.

    <p id="p-132"><strong>3. Counts 2, 3 and 4 are moot.</strong></p>
    <p id="p-133">In Count 2, Kilakila contended the Board violated HAR § 13-1-28, et seq. and HRS § 91-9, et seq. by failing to conduct a contested case hearing before the Board's 2010 Approval. Count 3 contended the Board's 2010 Approval was invalid because construction of the Telescope Project was contrary to the purpose of the conservation district. Count 4 contended the Board's 2010 Approval violated HAR Chapter 13-5 because the UH Appellees failed to meet the criteria of HAR § 13-5-30(c) (1994). Counts 2, 3 and 4 are moot because relief had already been granted by <em>BQP:0068</em> <em>'O Haleakala</em> , which remanded the controversy surrounding the Board's 2010 Approval of the Telescope Project to the circuit court on December 13, 2013. <em>See supra, I.C.; see also</em> <em>Wong v. Bd. of Regents, University of Hawai'i,</em> <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=62%20Haw.%20391" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="62 Haw. 391">62 Haw. 391</a>, 394-95, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=616%20P.2d%20201" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="616 P.2d 201">616 P.2d 201</a>, 203-04 (1980) (issue is moot if the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal-adverse interest and effective remedy-have been compromised). Consequently, the appeal from the circuit court's denial of Kilakila's motion to reconsider the dismissal of counts 2, 3 and 4 is also moot.</p>

      <p id="p-148">The parties dispute whether the Management Plan was exempted from the EA requirement as a planning document under HRS § 343-5(b). The [DLNR] contends the Management Plan is a planning document because it is not a land use. The University contends the circuit court made a factual finding that the Management Plan was a planning document and Kilakila's failure to contest the finding on appeal makes it binding on this court. Kilakila characterizes this contention as a meritless post-hoc argument because the University cited three § 343-5(a) triggers requiring an EA in the Management Plan's EA. Kilakila also contends the circuit court wrongly resolved a disputed fact on summary judgment. Regardless of whether an EA was required for the Management Plan, the University completed an EA, and HRS Chapter 343 requires an EIS if an EA concludes a significant environmental impact is likely. <em>See</em> HAR § 11-200-9(A)(4).</p>

The Management Plan concluded: "While a separate analysis of land use resources for the proposed [Telescope Project] describes specific impacts, it can be stated that this proposed project would be an incremental addition of approximately 4 percent to the use of Conservation District lands within HO and only a fraction of a percent of the total resource subzone." An EIS was completed for the Telescope Project.</p>
