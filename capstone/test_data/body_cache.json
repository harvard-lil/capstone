Dudley, for appellant.\nCamerina I. Brokaw-Zorrozua (of Maxey Law Office PS), for respondent.\nPennell, J.\n\u00b61 Superior court judges are authorized to review court commissioner decisions through a motion for revision. Although new evidence may not be considered, a judge acting on a motion for revision otherwise has plenary authority over the matter and may issue any findings or decisions that could have been entered by the commissioner.\n\u00b62 The broad authority conferred on superior court judges warranted the actions taken by the judge in this case. After Christy Lyle filed a motion to revise a commissioner\u2019s decision dismissing her petition to modify child support, the superior court judge was not restricted to either affirming or reversing the commissioner\u2019s order. Instead, on finding dismissal unwarranted, the judge was empowered to enter a child support award as had been requested by Ms. Lyle in her petition. The decision of the superior court judge is therefore affirmed.\nFACTS\n\u00b63 In 2014, Christy Lyle filed a petition to modify a 2009 child support order. Ms. Lyle asserted various grounds for modification under RCW 26.09.170. The petition was supported by declarations, as well as financial and other documentation. Ms. Lyle\u2019s former husband, Keith Lyle, opposed modification. He contended Ms. Lyle had not established a change of circumstances that would warrant revisiting the 2009 order. Mr. Lyle also submitted declarations and documentation supporting his position.\n\u00b64 A superior court commissioner heard argument on the petition after reviewing the parties\u2019 voluminous filings. No testimony was taken. The commissioner dismissed the petition for the reasons argued by Mr. Lyle, finding that Ms. Lyle had not shown a substantial change in circumstances or severe economic hardship as required for modification under RCW 26.09.170.\n\u00b65 Ms. Lyle filed a motion for revision of the commissioner\u2019s decision. A superior court judge heard oral argument on the motion and considered the materials that had been previously filed in support of and opposition to the petition to modify, together with a transcript of the commissioner\u2019s hearing. The judge ultimately granted Ms. Lyle\u2019s motion for revision and petition for modification, finding that she had established the following circumstances under RCW 26.09.170(5), (6), and (7): (1) a substantial change in circumstances based on the children entering into a new age category and their significantly increased expenses, (2) severe economic hardship, and (3) change in income. The judge also adopted Ms. Lyle\u2019s proposed child support work sheet. Mr. Lyle appeals.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b66 Mr. Lyle does not challenge the superior court judge\u2019s decision to revise the court commissioner. His complaint goes to the scope of the judge\u2019s order on revision. According to Mr. Lyle, once the superior court judge decided to revise the commissioner\u2019s ruling on whether there were grounds for modification, the matter should have been remanded to the commissioner for an assessment of applicable child support. We disagree with this restricted view of the superior court judge\u2019s power of revision.\n\u00b67 Court commissioners play an important role in our state\u2019s court system. They help alleviate the large caseloads facing superior court judges and facilitate the efficient administration of justice. State v. Smith, 117 Wn.2d 263, 280, 814 P.2d 652 (1991). Superior court commissioners derive their powers from our state\u2019s constitution and statute. Wash. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 23; ch. 2.24 RCW. They are conferred with most of the powers of a superior court judge but may not preside over jury trials. Wash. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 23. While superior court commissioners operate largely like their judicial counterparts, they are not subject to affidavits of prejudice under RCW 4.12.050. State v. Espinoza, 112 Wn.2d 819, 829, 774 P.2d 1177 (1989). Instead, a party dissatisfied with a commissioner\u2019s ruling can seek relief through a motion for revision. Smith, 117 Wn.2d at 280. The right to seek revision permits a litigant appearing before a commissioner to be treated similarly to one appearing before a superior court judge. Id. at 276.\n\u00b68 When a superior court judge receives a case through a motion for revision, the judge takes \u201cjurisdiction of the entire case as heard before the commissioner.\u201d State ex rel. Biddinger v. Griffiths, 137 Wash. 448, 451, 242 P. 969 (1926). Although the superior court judge cannot accept new evidence, RCW 2.24.050, a motion on revision is in all other respects equal to any other matter on the court\u2019s docket. The judge reviews the law and evidence de novo. State v. Ramer, 151 Wn.2d 106, 113, 116-17, 86 P.3d 132 (2004) (de novo standard applied even when commissioner heard live testimony). Should the judge disagree with the commissioner\u2019s disposition, the judge may issue his or her own independent factual findings and legal conclusions. Id. at 113; Iturribarria Perez v. Bazaldua Garcia, 148 Wn. App. 131, 138, 198 P.3d 539 (2009); Grieco v. Wilson, 144 Wn. App. 865, 877, 184 P.3d 668 (2008), aff\u2019d in part sub nom. In re Custody of E.A.T.W., 168 Wn.2d 335, 227 P.3d 1284 (2010). Any subsequent appeal to this court is one that reviews the decision of the superior court judge, not the commissioner. Ramer, 151 Wn.2d at 113.\n\u00b69 Given the foregoing analysis, it is apparent the superior court judge had authority not only to reverse the commissioner\u2019s decision regarding whether Ms. Lyle had established grounds for modification but also to provide an appropriate remedy. The judge could have remanded the case to the commissioner had the factual record been incomplete. In re Marriage of Moody, 137 Wn.2d 979, 992, 976 P.2d 1240 (1999). But doing so was not required. Because the factual record was complete, the superior court judge had full jurisdiction to decide Ms. Lyle\u2019s child support modification petition in its entirety. By exercising complete authority over the matter, the judge appropriately placed Ms. Lyle on equal footing with litigants whose cases are handled by superior court judges in their entirety. Remand to the commissioner for entry of child support orders would have been inefficient and contrary to the fundamental goals of the court commissioner process.\n\u00b610 Mr. Lyle complains that the superior court judge\u2019s determination deprived him of an opportunity to argue for a deviation from the standard child support schedule. We are unpersuaded. The ultimate issue before both the commissioner and the judge was Ms. Lyle\u2019s request for child support payments based on her proposed child support work sheet. Mr. Lyle was provided ample opportunity to resist Ms. Lyle\u2019s request in its entirety. Yet he never specifically requested a deviation. Instead, he focused on the foundational issue of whether Ms. Lyle had presented a sufficient basis for modification. The fact that Mr. Lyle\u2019s litigation strategy ultimately proved unsuccessful does not now require that he receive a new hearing. The procedure employed by the superior court judge was appropriate, and the court\u2019s decision on revision is affirmed in full.\nAPPELLATE ATTORNEY FEES\n\u00b6 11 Ms. Lyle requests a discretionary award of attorney fees under RCW 26.09.140. She has filed a financial declaration in compliance with RAP 18.1, indicating her monthly expenses exceed her net income. Mr. Lyle has not filed an answer to the financial declaration. Based on Ms. Lyle\u2019s successful defense of this appeal, her limited income, and the parties\u2019 disparate resources, we award reasonable costs and fees for this appeal to Ms. Lyle, provided she complies with RAP 18.1(d).\nFearing, C.J., and Korsmo, J., concur.\n1\nThe constitution states commissioners are empowered to \u201cperform like duties as a judge of the superior court at chambers.\u2019\u2019 Wash. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 23. The powers of a judge \u201cat chambers\u2019\u2019 extend to all matters not requiring a jury trial. See State ex rel. Lockhart v. Claypool, 132 Wash. 374, 375, 232 P. 351 (1925); In re Habeas Corpus of Olson, 12 Wn. App. 682, 685-87, 531 P.2d 508 (1975).\n2\nPrior to modification, neither parent had been obliged to make support payments, as the parents had entered into a shared parenting plan.\n",

Although new evidence may not be considered, a judge acting on a motion for revision otherwise has plenary authority over the matter and may issue any findings or decisions that could have been entered by the commissioner.\n\u00b62 The broad authority conferred on superior court judges warranted the actions taken by the judge in this case. After Christy Lyle filed a motion to revise a commissioner\u2019s decision dismissing her petition to modify child support, the superior court judge was not restricted to either affirming or reversing the commissioner\u2019s order. Instead, on finding dismissal unwarranted, the judge was empowered to enter a child support award as had been requested by Ms. Lyle in her petition. The decision of the superior court judge is therefore affirmed.\nFACTS\n\u00b63 In 2014, Christy Lyle filed a petition to modify a 2009 child support order. Ms. Lyle asserted various grounds for modification under RCW 26.09.170. The petition was supported by declarations, as well as financial and other documentation. Ms. Lyle\u2019s former husband, Keith Lyle, opposed modification. He contended Ms. Lyle had not established a change of circumstances that would warrant revisiting the 2009 order. Mr. Lyle also submitted declarations and documentation supporting his position.\n\u00b64 A superior court commissioner heard argument on the petition after reviewing the parties\u2019 voluminous filings. No testimony was taken. The commissioner dismissed the petition for the reasons argued by Mr. Lyle, finding that Ms. Lyle had not shown a substantial change in circumstances or severe economic hardship as required for modification under RCW 26.09.170.\n\u00b65 Ms. Lyle filed a motion for revision of the commissioner\u2019s decision. A superior court judge heard oral argument on the motion and considered the materials that had been previously filed in support of and opposition to the petition to modify, together with a transcript of the commissioner\u2019s hearing. The judge ultimately granted Ms. Lyle\u2019s motion for revision and petition for modification, finding that she had established the following circumstances under RCW 26.09.170(5), (6), and (7): (1) a substantial change in circumstances based on the children entering into a new age category and their significantly increased expenses, (2) severe economic hardship, and (3) change in income. The judge also adopted Ms. Lyle\u2019s proposed child support work sheet. Mr. Lyle appeals.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b66 Mr. Lyle does not challenge the superior court judge\u2019s decision to revise the court commissioner. His complaint goes to the scope of the judge\u2019s order on revision. According to Mr. Lyle, once the superior court judge decided to revise the commissioner\u2019s ruling on whether there were grounds for modification, the matter should have been remanded to the commissioner for an assessment of applicable child support. We disagree with this restricted view of the superior court judge\u2019s power of revision.\n\u00b67 Court commissioners play an important role in our state\u2019s court system. They help alleviate the large caseloads facing superior court judges and facilitate the efficient administration of justice. State v. Smith, 117 Wn.2d 263, 280, 814 P.2d 652 (1991). Superior court commissioners derive their powers from our state\u2019s constitution and statute. Wash. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 23; ch. 2.24 RCW. They are conferred with most of the powers of a superior court judge but may not preside over jury trials. Wash. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 23. While superior court commissioners operate largely like their judicial counterparts, they are not subject to affidavits of prejudice under RCW 4.12.050. State v. Espinoza, 112 Wn.2d 819, 829, 774 P.2d 1177 (1989). Instead, a party dissatisfied with a commissioner\u2019s ruling can seek relief through a motion for revision. Smith, 117 Wn.2d at 280. The right to seek revision permits a litigant appearing before a commissioner to be treated similarly to one appearing before a superior court judge. Id. at 276.\n\u00b68 When a superior court judge receives a case through a motion for revision, the judge takes \u201cjurisdiction of the entire case as heard before the commissioner.\u201d State ex rel. Biddinger v. Griffiths, 137 Wash. 448, 451, 242 P. 969 (1926). Although the superior court judge cannot accept new evidence, RCW 2.24.050, a motion on revision is in all other respects equal to any other matter on the court\u2019s docket. The judge reviews the law and evidence de novo. State v. Ramer, 151 Wn.2d 106, 113, 116-17, 86 P.3d 132 (2004) (de novo standard applied even when commissioner heard live testimony). Should the judge disagree with the commissioner\u2019s disposition, the judge may issue his or her own independent factual findings and legal conclusions. Id. at 113; Iturribarria Perez v. Bazaldua Garcia, 148 Wn. App. 131, 138, 198 P.3d 539 (2009); Grieco v. Wilson, 144 Wn. App. 865, 877, 184 P.3d 668 (2008), aff\u2019d in part sub nom. In re Custody of E.A.T.W., 168 Wn.2d 335, 227 P.3d 1284 (2010). Any subsequent appeal to this court is one that reviews the decision of the superior court judge, not the commissioner. Ramer, 151 Wn.2d at 113.\n\u00b69 Given the foregoing analysis, it is apparent the superior court judge had authority not only to reverse the commissioner\u2019s decision regarding whether Ms. Lyle had established grounds for modification but also to provide an appropriate remedy. The judge could have remanded the case to the commissioner had the factual record been incomplete. In re Marriage of Moody, 137 Wn.2d 979, 992, 976 P.2d 1240 (1999). But doing so was not required.

By exercising complete authority over the matter, the judge appropriately placed Ms. Lyle on equal footing with litigants whose cases are handled by superior court judges in their entirety.

We are unpersuaded. The ultimate issue before both the commissioner and the judge was Ms. Lyle\u2019s request for child support payments based on her proposed child support work sheet. Mr. Lyle was provided ample opportunity to resist Ms. Lyle\u2019s request in its entirety. Yet he never specifically requested a deviation. Instead, he focused on the foundational issue of whether Ms. Lyle had presented a sufficient basis for modification. The fact that Mr. Lyle\u2019s litigation strategy ultimately proved unsuccessful does not now require that he receive a new hearing. The procedure employed by the superior court judge was appropriate, and the court\u2019s decision on revision is affirmed in full.\nAPPELLATE ATTORNEY FEES\n\u00b6 11 Ms. Lyle requests a discretionary award of attorney fees under RCW 26.09.140.

And we equally contend that it was never intended to permit one solid sum, owing by a garnishee debt- or, greatly above the jurisdiction of a Justice, to be split up and used up and dissipated in petty suits and costs in every county of the State.\nLacey, J.\nThis cause is submitted on an agreed state of facts, as follows: Wm. Kirk being a judgment creditor of John Kirk, in the Circuit Court of Woodford County, in the sum of \u00a71,055, after first having execution issued against the judgment debtor and returned by the Sheriff, no property found, caused- to be issued out of said court garnishee process against the appellant as garnishee of John Kirk. It is admitted that at the time of the service of said writ the appellant owed said John Kirk \u00a71,450 for loss on a certain policy of insurance, unless reduced by certain credits claimed by the appellant, and not otherwise indebted. The credits claimed are for judgments paid by the appellant, recovered in certain cases in similar garnishee proceedings commenced against it for the debts of John Kirk, a portion in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and others by John Kirk\u2019s creditors in Justiee courts in Cook and Peoria counties, which were commenced and served prior to^tlie service of process in this suit. The court below admitted the credit for the amount of the two garnishee judgments rendered in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and rejected the credits claimed on account of the payment by appellant of the said Justice of the Peace judgments, on the sole ground, as the agreed state of facts show, that the Justices in the respective cases had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter in controversy, because the amount in the hands of the garnishee exceeded the sum of \u00a7200 at the time of the service of the writ of garnishment therein, and the court thereupon rendered judgment against appellant for the sum of \u00a7824.40, the balance remaining due after allowing the credits above stated; from which judgment this appeal is taken.\nIt is further stipulated that if this court shall hold that the court below committed no error in such ruling then the judgment shall be affirmed; but, on the contrary, if this court shall be of the opinion that the court below improperly rejected as a credit in favor of the appellant, the amount paid on the several Justice\u2019s judgments, then this court shall render a judgment in favor of the garnishceing creditor of John Kirk, a judgment for \u00a7407.11, instead of \u00a7824.40 as entered in the court below.\nAnd this is the only question in this case. We are of the opinion that the jurisdiction in cases of garnishment before a Justice of the Peace, where the garnishee proceeding, as in this case, is based on a judgment in favor of the garnisheeing creditor against the judgment debtor, depends upon and is governed by the amount of such judgment interest and costs remaining due thereon, even if such amount, by reason of the accumulation of interests and costs, exceeds, when added to the original judgment, \u00a7200. This same question was decided by this court in the case of Nesbit v. Dickover, in which the opinion was filed December 11,1886. The same point involved in this case was involved in that.\nThe argument in favor of the appellee rests wholly on the assumption that the judgment in the garnishee proceedings should be rendered in favor of the judgment debtor for the use of the judgment creditor, against the garnished party, for the whole amount due, and in case of failure to so render judgment for such amount and for a less amount than due, the balance over and above the amount of the judgment so rendered would be barred on the grounds of former recovery.\nThe contention of the appellee is supported by certain cases in which the Supreme Court in this State holds that it is the proper practice to have the suit and judgment entered as* in favor of the judgment debtor for use of the judgment creditor against the garnishee; and the court in several cases highly recommend that such be the form as will be seen in the following cases among others: Stahl v. Webster, 11 Ill. 511; Hitchcock v. Watson, 18 Ill. 289; Farrell v. Pearson, 26 Ill. 463; Cariker v. Anderson, 27 Ill. 358; Towner v. George, 53 Ill. 168. But we are unable to find any case holding that it is indispensably requisite-that in this class of cases the judgment should be in that form; on the contrary many judgments have been affirmed where the garnisheeing creditor was the plaintiff, and none, so far as we have been able to find, have been reversed solely for the reason such form was not followed. The statute itself does not require any such form and the Supreme Court only recommends its use.\nThe Justice\u2019s judgments in these cases were under $200, and if the Justice\u2019s jurisdiction as to the subject-matter is governed by the amount of the judgment rendered, then clearly the Justice did not exceed its jurisdiction. The Justice of the Peace judgments were not void on their face and they are brought in here collaterally. How, it may be asked, can the appellee complain that the appellant failed to insist on dismissal, even if he had legal right to insist that the garnishee proceedings should have been dismissed by the Justice for want of jurisdiction? Who were the parties to the s nit before the Justice? Manifestly no one but the applicant, the judgment debtor, as plaintiff, to whom the appellant owed the insurance money, and the judgment creditor, who was attempting to collect the judgment. Those three parties certainly could control the proceedings before the Justice. Wm. Kirk, appellee\u2019s use in this case, was not a party, and cotild not then nor can he now be heard to complain if the parties in that case made no objection to the Justice rendering an amount of judgment within his jurisdiction. Suppose it had been an ordinary suit in favor of John Kirk against appellant brought on the insurance policy, and on the hearing it appeared that there was due John Kirk the sum of $1,450; evidently if John Kirk insisted on this amount the Justice would have been compelled \u2022to dismiss for the want of jurisdiction. John Kirk could have remitted all except $200 and taken a judgment for that amount in spite of the objection of the appellant; but this would have been a bar to any further recovery. Raymond v. Strobel, 24 Ill. 113; Carpenter v. Wells, 65 Ill. 451. If the taking a judgment before the Justice in the cases in question was a bar, then it would follow that the appellee\u2019s use, Wm. Kirk, or appellee for his use, could not recover anything in this suit. Ko one appealed from those Justice judgments, and certainly appellant was not bound to appeal for the benefit of some possible garnisheeing creditor to follow, on penalty of again paying the several Justice judgments on appellee\u2019s garnishee process. Appellant does not insist on any bar here against Wm. Kirk\u2019s claim as to the balance owed on the insurance policy above the amounts it has paid on the various judgments in question. We are inclined to hold that such judgments may be entered up in favor of the garnisheeing creditor for the amount only due him and that it is no bar in favor of the garnishee against the creditor as to the balance due. In the nature of the ease, it should be so. The garnisheeing, creditor controls the suit and is not interested in protecting his debtor\u2019s rights as against the garnishee, only so far as the amount of his claim is concerned, and \"no further; and he is not bound to incur the trouble and expense of establishing his debtor\u2019s entire claim which often would be heavy; again, he might not have the necessary information to do so. \u2022 The garnishee process is in the nature of process to obtain satisfaction of a judgment. Chanub et al. v. Martin, 25 Ill. 63; Cariker v. Anderson, 27 Ill. 358; Gillett v. Richards, 46 Iowa, 652. In the nature of the ease, the Legislature could never have intended that the entire merits of the entire case as between the original debtor and creditor should be litigated in the garnishee proceedings. See Drake on Attachments, See. 707; Freeman on Judgments, 167. The Supreme Court 'has affirmed judgments in cases similar to this; Wilcus v. Kling, 87 Ill. 107; Phelps v. Reeder, 39 Ill. 172; Luton v. Hoehn, 72 Ill. 81. In so far as the case of Haines v. O\u2019Conner, 5 Ill. App. 213, conflicts with the views here expressed we do not approve of it.\nIn accordance with the agreement herein and the law in such cases, the judgment of the court below is reversed and judgment is hereby rendered in this court in favor of appellee against appellant for the sum of $407.11 and costs of this court charged against appellee.\nJudgment reversed and judgment entered in this court.\n",

How, it may be asked, can the appellee complain that the appellant failed to insist on dismissal, even if he had legal right to insist that the garnishee proceedings should have been dismissed by the Justice for want of jurisdiction? Who were the parties to the s nit before the Justice? Manifestly no one but the applicant, the judgment debtor, as plaintiff, to whom the appellant owed the insurance money, and the judgment creditor, who was attempting to collect the judgment. Those three parties certainly could control the proceedings before the Justice. Wm. Kirk, appellee\u2019s use in this case, was not a party, and cotild not then nor can he now be heard to complain if the parties in that case made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>objection to the Justice rendering an amount of judgment within his jurisdiction. Suppose it had been an ordinary suit in favor of John Kirk against appellant brought on the insurance policy, and on the hearing it appeared that there was due John Kirk the sum of $1,450; evidently if John Kirk insisted on this amount the Justice would have been compelled \u2022to dismiss for the want of jurisdiction. John Kirk could have remitted all except $200 and taken a judgment for that amount in spite of the objection of the appellant; but this would have been a bar to any further recovery. Raymond v. Strobel, 24 Ill. 113; Carpenter v. Wells, 65 Ill. 451. If the taking a judgment before the Justice in the cases in question was a bar, then it would follow that the appellee\u2019s use, Wm. Kirk, or appellee for his use, could not recover anything in this suit. Ko one appealed from those Justice judgments, and certainly appellant was not bound to appeal for the benefit of some possible garnisheeing creditor to follow, on penalty of again paying the several Justice judgments on appellee\u2019s garnishee process. Appellant does not insist on any bar here against Wm. Kirk\u2019s claim as to the balance owed on the insurance policy above the amounts it has paid on the various judgments in question. We are inclined to hold that such judgments may be entered up in favor of the garnisheeing creditor for the amount only due him and that it is no bar in favor of the garnishee against the creditor as to the balance due. In the nature of the ease, it should be so. The garnisheeing, creditor controls the suit and is not interested in protecting his debtor\u2019s rights as against the garnishee, only so far as the amount of his claim is concerned, and \"no further; and he is not bound to incur the trouble and expense of establishing his debtor\u2019s entire claim which often would be heavy; again, he might not have the necessary information to do so. \u2022 The garnishee process is in the nature of process to obtain satisfaction of a judgment. Chanub et al. v. Martin, 25 Ill. 63; Cariker v. Anderson, 27 Ill. 358; Gillett v. Richards, 46 Iowa, 652. In the nature of the ease, the Legislature could never have intended that the entire merits of the entire case as between the original debtor and creditor should be litigated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>in the garnishee proceedings. See Drake on Attachments, See. 707; Freeman on Judgments, 167. The Supreme Court 'has affirmed judgments in cases similar to this; Wilcus v. Kling, 87 Ill. 107; Phelps v.

                        "text": "Lacey, J.\nThis cause is submitted on an agreed state of facts, as follows: Wm. Kirk being a judgment creditor of John Kirk, in the Circuit Court of Woodford County, in the sum of \u00a71,055, after first having execution issued against the judgment debtor and returned by the Sheriff, no property found, caused- to be issued out of said court garnishee process against the appellant as garnishee of John Kirk. It is admitted that at the time of the service of said writ the appellant owed said John Kirk \u00a71,450 for loss on a certain policy of insurance, unless reduced by certain credits claimed by the appellant, and not otherwise indebted. The credits claimed are for judgments paid by the appellant, recovered in certain cases in similar garnishee proceedings commenced against it for the debts of John Kirk, a portion in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and others by John Kirk\u2019s creditors in Justiee courts in Cook and Peoria counties, which were commenced and served prior to^tlie service of process in this suit. The court below admitted the credit for the amount of the two garnishee judgments rendered in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and rejected the credits claimed on account of the payment by appellant of the said Justice of the Peace judgments, on the sole ground, as the agreed state of facts show, that the Justices in the respective cases had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter in controversy, because the amount in the hands of the garnishee exceeded the sum of \u00a7200 at the time of the service of the writ of garnishment therein, and the court thereupon rendered judgment against appellant for the sum of \u00a7824.40, the balance remaining due after allowing the credits above stated; from which judgment this appeal is taken.\nIt is further stipulated that if this court shall hold that the court below committed no error in such ruling then the judgment shall be affirmed; but, on the contrary, if this court shall be of the opinion that the court below improperly rejected as a credit in favor of the appellant, the amount paid on the several Justice\u2019s judgments, then this court shall render a judgment in favor of the garnishceing creditor of John Kirk, a judgment for \u00a7407.11, instead of \u00a7824.40 as entered in the court below.\nAnd this is the only question in this case. We are of the opinion that the jurisdiction in cases of garnishment before a Justice of the Peace, where the garnishee proceeding, as in this case, is based on a judgment in favor of the garnisheeing creditor against the judgment debtor, depends upon and is governed by the amount of such judgment interest and costs remaining due thereon, even if such amount, by reason of the accumulation of interests and costs, exceeds, when added to the original judgment, \u00a7200. This same question was decided by this court in the case of Nesbit v. Dickover, in which the opinion was filed December 11,1886. The same point involved in this case was involved in that.\nThe argument in favor of the appellee rests wholly on the assumption that the judgment in the garnishee proceedings should be rendered in favor of the judgment debtor for the use of the judgment creditor, against the garnished party, for the whole amount due, and in case of failure to so render judgment for such amount and for a less amount than due, the balance over and above the amount of the judgment so rendered would be barred on the grounds of former recovery.\nThe contention of the appellee is supported by certain cases in which the Supreme Court in this State holds that it is the proper practice to have the suit and judgment entered as* in favor of the judgment debtor for use of the judgment creditor against the garnishee; and the court in several cases highly recommend that such be the form as will be seen in the following cases among others: Stahl v. Webster, 11 Ill. 511; Hitchcock v. Watson, 18 Ill. 289; Farrell v. Pearson, 26 Ill. 463; Cariker v. Anderson, 27 Ill. 358; Towner v. George, 53 Ill. 168. But we are unable to find any case holding that it is indispensably requisite-that in this class of cases the judgment should be in that form; on the contrary many judgments have been affirmed where the garnisheeing creditor was the plaintiff, and none, so far as we have been able to find, have been reversed solely for the reason such form was not followed. The statute itself does not require any such form and the Supreme Court only recommends its use.\nThe Justice\u2019s judgments in these cases were under $200, and if the Justice\u2019s jurisdiction as to the subject-matter is governed by the amount of the judgment rendered, then clearly the Justice did not exceed its jurisdiction. The Justice of the Peace judgments were not void on their face and they are brought in here collaterally. How, it may be asked, can the appellee complain that the appellant failed to insist on dismissal, even if he had legal right to insist that the garnishee proceedings should have been dismissed by the Justice for want of jurisdiction? Who were the parties to the s nit before the Justice? Manifestly no one but the applicant, the judgment debtor, as plaintiff, to whom the appellant owed the insurance money, and the judgment creditor, who was attempting to collect the judgment. Those three parties certainly could control the proceedings before the Justice. Wm. Kirk, appellee\u2019s use in this case, was not a party, and cotild not then nor can he now be heard to complain if the parties in that case made no objection to the Justice rendering an amount of judgment within his jurisdiction. Suppose it had been an ordinary suit in favor of John Kirk against appellant brought on the insurance policy, and on the hearing it appeared that there was due John Kirk the sum of $1,450; evidently if John Kirk insisted on this amount the Justice would have been compelled \u2022to dismiss for the want of jurisdiction. John Kirk could have remitted all except $200 and taken a judgment for that amount in spite of the objection of the appellant; but this would have been a bar to any further recovery. Raymond v. Strobel, 24 Ill. 113; Carpenter v. Wells, 65 Ill. 451. If the taking a judgment before the Justice in the cases in question was a bar, then it would follow that the appellee\u2019s use, Wm. Kirk, or appellee for his use, could not recover anything in this suit. Ko one appealed from those Justice judgments, and certainly appellant was not bound to appeal for the benefit of some possible garnisheeing creditor to follow, on penalty of again paying the several Justice judgments on appellee\u2019s garnishee process. Appellant does not insist on any bar here against Wm. Kirk\u2019s claim as to the balance owed on the insurance policy above the amounts it has paid on the various judgments in question. We are inclined to hold that such judgments may be entered up in favor of the garnisheeing creditor for the amount only due him and that it is no bar in favor of the garnishee against the creditor as to the balance due. In the nature of the ease, it should be so. The garnisheeing, creditor controls the suit and is not interested in protecting his debtor\u2019s rights as against the garnishee, only so far as the amount of his claim is concerned, and \"no further; and he is not bound to incur the trouble and expense of establishing his debtor\u2019s entire claim which often would be heavy; again, he might not have the necessary information to do so. \u2022 The garnishee process is in the nature of process to obtain satisfaction of a judgment.

In the nature of the ease, the Legislature could never have intended that the entire merits of the entire case as between the original debtor and creditor should be litigated in the garnishee proceedings.
